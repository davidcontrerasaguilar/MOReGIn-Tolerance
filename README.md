# Balancing Global and Individual Perspectives in Multi-Objective Recommender Systems

This repository contains the implementation of a Multi-Objective Recommender System (MORS) capable of producing recommendations that meet both global and individual objectives.

## Overview

The algorithm focuses on two main objectives:

1. **Global Objectives: Provider Fairness**
   - Ensures that the recommendations are fair across different providers, preventing any single provider from dominating the recommendation list.

2. **Individual Objectives: Calibrated Recommendations**
   - Ensures that the recommendations are well-calibrated to individual user preferences, providing a personalized experience.

This dual focus aligns with the broader MORS literature, which addresses multiple beyond-accuracy objectives. While we refer to our approach as provider-fair and calibrated recommendations, it is generalizable to any set of global and individual objectives.

## Features

- **Provider Fairness**: Balances the exposure among various providers to ensure equitable treatment.
- **Calibrated Recommendations**: Tailors the recommendations to align with individual user preferences and interests.
- **Generalizable Framework**: Can be adapted to incorporate different sets of global and individual objectives.


## Usage

To use the algorithm, follow these steps:
